💾 Saving with Joblib (Recommended)
import joblib

# Save the model to a file
joblib.dump(lr_gs, filename="tuned_logistic_regression_model.joblib")

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = joblib.load(filename="tuned_logistic_regression_model.joblib")

📂 How to Load it later

When you start a new project or build a website, you can bring the model back to life with just one line:
# Use it to make a prediction
# loaded_model.predict(new_data)
