# List Methods
   
# In Python, lists are a built-in data type that allows you to store a collection of items. Lists come with several built-in methods that make it easy to manipulate and work with the data they contain. Here are some commonly used list methods:

shopping_cart = ['balls', 'bananas', 'orange']
new_list = shopping_cart.append('grapes') #append wala function none return krta hai
#new_list = shopping_cart.insert(2, 'apple')
#shopping_cart.remove('orange')#remove wala function none return krta hai
#new_list = shopping_cart.pop(0)
print(new_list)
print(shopping_cart)
