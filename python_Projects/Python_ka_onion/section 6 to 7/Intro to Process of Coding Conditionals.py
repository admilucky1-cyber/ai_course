#Intro to Process of Coding Conditionals
#Conditionals are used to perform different actions based on whether a certain condition is true or false.
#The basic structure of a conditional statement in Python is the "if" statement, which can be followed by "elif" (else if) and "else" statements.

#The page titled "47. Intro to Process of Coding Conditionals" appears to be part of a course on machine learning, AI, or data science. Based on the surrounding page content, this section likely introduces the foundational concepts and practical steps involved in implementing conditional logic in code.
#
#Here's what this lesson likely covers:
#🧠 Understanding Conditionals: An introduction to conditional statements (like if, else if, and else) used in programming to make decisions based on certain conditions.
#
#🧪 Use Cases: Examples of how conditionals are used in real-world scenarios, such as checking if a value meets a threshold or branching logic in algorithms.

#🧱 Syntax and Structure: Explanation of how to write conditional statements in a specific programming language (likely Python, given its popularity in ML/AI courses).

#🔁 Flow Control: How conditionals affect the flow of a program, allowing it to respond dynamically to different inputs or states.

#🛠️ Hands-On Coding: The lesson may include a coding exercise or demonstration to help learners practice writing and testing conditional logic.

#If you're working through this course, this lesson is a key stepping stone toward building more complex logic in your machine learning or data science projects. Would you like a quick example of a conditional in Python to reinforce the concept?
