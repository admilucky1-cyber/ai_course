    "Definition: A style of programming where you explicitly write step‑by‑step instructions for the computer to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow: You define procedures (functions) and control structures (loops, conditionals) that dictate exactly how input is processed to produce output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "python\n",
    "def calculate_area(length, width):\n",
    "    return length * width\n",
    "\n",
    "print(calculate_area(5, 10))\n",
    "Here, the programmer specifies the exact formula and steps.\n",

    "## Machine Learning Models # \n",
    "new computer learns  from data and computer will do set of instructions that's it:\n",
    "#### Definition: Instead of hard‑coding rules, you provide data and let the computer learn patterns automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow: You train a model with examples, and it generalizes to make predictions on new inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",

    "python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",

    "X = [[5], [10], [15]]   # input data\n",

    "model = LinearRegression()\n",
    "model.fit(X, y)\n",

    "print(model.predict([[20]]))  # model learns the relationship\n",
    "Here, the computer figures out the relationship between input and output without us explicitly coding the formula.\n",

    "##### Key Difference\n",
    "### Procedural programming: You tell the computer how to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine learning: You give the computer examples and it learns how to solve the problem itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### This shift is why ML feels so different—it’s about teaching computers to adapt rather than instructing them step by step."
