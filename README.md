## 3. Push the change to GitHub
Ubuntu makes it easy to check your work before pushing. Run these:

1.  **Check status:** `git status` (You'll see README.md in red).
2.  **Stage and Save:**
    ```bash
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "docs: create main readme"
    ```
3.  **Upload:**
    ```bash
    git push
    ```

### Extra Ubuntu Tip: "Gitg"
Since you are on Ubuntu, if you want a visual way to see your repository history, you can install a cool tool called `gitg`. 
Run: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install gitg`. 
Then just type `gitg` in your terminal inside the folder to see a "tree" of all your saves!

**Would you like me to help you create a specific README for the "Python_ka_onion" folder inside the main project?**
